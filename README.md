# DHCP PCAP Analysis

A beginner-friendly DHCP-focused packet capture analysis. This repository demonstrates how to extract and analyze DHCP traffic using Wireshark — a foundational skill in SOC and digital forensics workflows.

---

## 📁 Files Included
- `dhcp.cap` - Original DHCP packet capture file.  
- `analysis/dhcp_analysis_notes.md` - Step-by-step analysis with findings.  
- `filters.txt` - Wireshark filters used during analysis.  

---

## 🔧 Tools Used
- **Wireshark** – for packet inspection.  
- **Basic Linux commands** (optional).  
- **Git & GitHub** – version control and repository hosting.  

---

## 🧪 Analysis Performed
- Extracted and examined all DHCP packets.  
- Differentiated DHCP queries and responses.  
- Observed domain name queries and resolved IPs.  
- Checked for repeated queries and anomalous responses.  
- Identified potential triage flags (e.g., multiple responses to a single query).  

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- How DHCP queries and responses work.  
- How to use Wireshark filters for DHCP analysis.  
- How to identify basic indicators of compromise (IOCs) in DHCP traffic.  
- Importance of triage in SOC workflows.  

---

## 📌 Use Case
This repository is useful for:
- Students learning cybersecurity fundamentals.  
- Beginners practicing packet analysis.  
- SOC Level 1 aspirants learning triage basics.  
- Anyone exploring DHCP packet behavior.
